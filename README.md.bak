# Kickstarting with Excel - An Analysis of Kickstarting Campaigns

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This module was designed to give students a foundation of how data is used to provide answers to real-world questions
thru data visualization. The Crowdfunding Project provided Louise with information on how various crowdfunding events fared 
over time and outcomes by event categories and subcategories.   

The module gives students a crash course in Excel as this tool has basic capabilities to see data as rows and columns whose 
points can be plotted on various types of graphs so that students can analyze and draw conclusions based on what they 
see in those graphs.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

There were a total number of 4114 Crowdfunding events.  
For all categories, the total number of successful outcomes was always higher than the failures except in December.  
Number of cancelled outcomes were significantly lower than successful and failed outcomes.

If you choose theater as parent category, there are signifcantly more successful outcomes than failed which is more consistent with ALL outcomes.  There were 1369 projects in the theater parent cateogry where the outcome was successful, failed or cancelled.  
Live was not included in the analysis.

However, if you choose food as parent category, there are much more failed than succesful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

There were 1047 projects for the plays subcategory where the outcomes were either successful, failed or cancelled.  Live was
not part of the analysis.    

There was a range missing in the Goal column.  There were 4 plays where the goal was exactly $50,000.  But, the goal ranges didn't
have a bucket where goal > OR = $50,000.

Plays never had a cancelled outcome, they were either successful, failed or live.  You can see all 0 in Number Cancelled Column.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Had trouble with figuring out how to sort the column outcomes as pictured in Step 12 Deliverable 1.  I tried to
highlight the column headings thinking I could prioritize the sort so that successful came first.  Then, I realized
that the sort was actually in descending alphabetic order.  And remembered that I can click on the drop down and 
choose sort Z-A.

I had more trouble in Deliverable 2.  There were so many manual steps here.  I was copying VLOOKUPs down and across the 
columns and then manually went in an adjusted.  I think I should have used the trick to "name" the data selection for 
each, GOAL column and OUTCOME column so that I could simply copy and paste with less error.  

The number of failed goals was a challenge as the total number of failures for plays in the kickstarter tab did not match
the sum of the number failed in the table (353 vs 349 respectively).  4 of them were exactly $50k which represents the difference.
When I rechecked my work on Friday 2/4, I noticed that someone had changed the challenge in Deliverable 2...  
The last range was changed to "50000 or More" instead of "Greater than 50000".   So, I redid the last range to match and totals matched.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

(1) For parent category theater, success and failure seem to follow a similar outcome trend.   
(2) Highest success and highest failure occur in May if you choose Theater as the parent category.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

(1) Goals less than 5000 dollars have the highest success rate as the percentage successful is above 72%.  We can also see that goals
between 35000 and 44999 also have a high number of successful outcomes vs. failed outcomes.  But, see limitations below.

(2) The highest failure and lowest success seems to occur when the goal is 45000 to 49999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

(1) For the Outcome Based on Goals tab, the number of projects for each range is not the same. There is only 1 project in
the 45000 - 49999 range while Less than a 1000 had 186 projects and 1000 to 4999 had 534.  So, you don't have enough
points to say that having a goal in the 45000 to 49999 is not achievable.  There is not enough projects with a 
goal in that range to deter setting a goal in that range for a future event.

(2) Similarly Goals between 35000 and 44999 have a high success rate (66.67%), but there were only a few projects (6 and 3 respectively) and may reflect differently if there were more projects 
	in those ranges. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Would be interesting to have a stacked bar chart that compared parent categories (X axis) to outcomes (Y axis) to see which ones tend to be
more successful or failed.
